# Authorization Service

The Authorization Service is designed to generate tokens using the RSA certificate algorithm. The endpoint is secured by a token service to prevent unauthorized token generation. Token validation is performed through a JWKS endpoint ("/.well-known/jwks").

## What is a JSON Web Token (JWT)?

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard authentication token based on JSON. It securely represents claims between two parties. A JWT consists of three parts: a header, claims, and a signature. Learn more on https://jwt.io/

## How the Authorization Service Works

The Authorization Service provides the following functionalities:

1. **Token Generation with RSA Algorithm**: This service uses the RSA certificate algorithm to generate tokens. The RSA algorithm ensures robust security by using a private key to sign the token and a public key to verify the signature.

2. **Endpoint Secured by Token Service**: To prevent unauthorized token generation, the endpoint is secured by a token service. This service verifies the appropriate permissions before generating a token.

3. **JWT Token Validation via JWKS Endpoint**: The Authorization Service offers a JWKS endpoint ("/.well-known/jwks") for validating JWT tokens. This endpoint contains the necessary public keys for verifying token signatures. When a client sends a JWT token to the JWKS endpoint, the Authorization Service validates the token's authenticity using the corresponding public keys.

## How to Use the Authorization Service

To use the Authorization Service, follow these steps:

1. **Generating a JWT Token**:

   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to generate a token.
   - Send a request to the designated token generation endpoint, providing the appropriate credentials.
   - The Authorization Service will generate a secure JWT token using the RSA certificate algorithm.

2. **Validating a JWT Token**:
   - Obtain a JWT token from a client or another source.
   - Send a request to the JWKS endpoint ("/.well-known/jwks") of the Authorization Service, including the JWT token in the request header.
   - The Authorization Service will validate the token's authenticity by decoding it and checking the signature using the public keys from the JWKS.
   - If the token is valid, the service will respond indicating that the token is authentic. Otherwise, it will indicate that the token is invalid or expired.

## Conclusion

The Authorization Service is a powerful tool for managing JWT tokens with the RSA certificate algorithm. By securing the token generation endpoint and utilizing a JWKS endpoint for validation, this service enhances the security of your application.

We hope this pedagogical README has provided you with the necessary information about the Authorization Service's functionality. Feel free to consult additional documentation for more details on different features and endpoints.
